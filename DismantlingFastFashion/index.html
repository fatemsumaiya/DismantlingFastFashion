      <h2> About </h2>
      <p> The first time I opened up Shein, I found out that I can pratically get anything I want at a affordable price.
        And it was unreal. As someone who easily gets overstimulated at stores and spends hours to buy one dress, I
        found out that everything I wanted was right underneath a google search. However, there's a catch. There has to
        be a catch, right? Logically, it makes no sense that SHEIN not only has 10 pages of abayahs, burkinis AND 50
        pages of maxi dress and crop tops. How is SHEIN able to catch up with the demand? How is everything getting
        made? And most importantly, how is SHEIN able to make money with $3 shirts?</p>
      <p>These are all important and needed questions to ask. Shein is a fast fashion company, similar to H&M, Old Navy
        and Uniqlo. Fast Fashion companies specificlaly cater to trends, they make a large batch of clothes to cater to
        today's trend and then manafactuare and develop clothes for upcoming trends. However, trends come and die out.
        Once a trend has died out, a large amount of clothes are thrown out and a new batch appears the next day.</p>
      <p>
        To meet the demands of trends, companies manufacture in countries where industry regulations are not regulated
        or have cheap labor (think China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam or Philippines). By manufacturing overseas,
        companies do not hold any legal consequences to their exploitation of workers in sweatshops. In fact, according
        to earth.org, the average wage in sweatshops is 58 cents <a
          href="https://earth.org/sweatshops-and-fast-fashion-the-human-and-environmental-cost-of-cheap-clothing/">(Sweatshops
          and Fast Fashion…)</a>, with workers earning an average of $133-$160 per month- living wage in India is $234 a
        month <a
          href="https://clb.org.hk/en/content/collective-bargaining-action-india%E2%80%99s-garment-workers-ask-brands-wage-increase#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Delhi%2Dbased,industry%20think%20tank%20Trading%20Economics.">(Collective
          bargaining in action)</a>. Workers often have to work long hours, 12-15 hours a day in unsafe environments to
        bring food on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        To meet the demands of trends and gain profit, fast fashion companies must sell more products taking a
        significant environmental toll. Companies also has opted to using cheaper materials such as polyster which does
        not break down well. Since companies use cheaper materials to produce inexpensive clothing, clothes are,
        unfortunately, not made well and often wear down easily causing more people to discard their clothes to
        landfills or donate. However, donating is not as effective as people think it is. Since too many clothes get
        donated, clothes get shipped overseas and are stored in large warehouses. Many countries that have a surplus of
        donated clothes have resorted to incinerating clothes furthering producing methane into the air.
      </p>
      <p> Not only is fast fashion a human rights issue, it is also an environmental issue. Not only should large
        corporations be held accountable for exploiting workers, laws need to be enforced to ensure that clothes are
        getting recycled properly and ethically made. </p>

      <p>While it may not be accessible to everyone, the easiest thing you can do is boycott fashion brands, reuse your clothes, and buy used clothing. The more we tell companies we won’t buy clothes made from the backs of women, the more companies feel pressured to change. Hit them where it hurts!</p>
      <p>How do I know which brands to avoid?</p>

      <p> Recognizing a Fast Fashion Brand </p>
      <div class="bullet">
        <li> way too many clothes offered at a cheap price </li>
        <li> made in countries where manufacturing is cheap: China, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Philippines, Vietnam </li>
        <li> a limited supply- gives us the impression that if we don’t buy this now, we won’t be able to get it again
        </li>
      </div>
      <p> It’s important to note that not everyone can avoid buying from fast fashion brands. It may be hard to get
        professional attire in a thrift store and it may be hard to buy underwear/socks made sustainability. As
        sustainable brands pay their workers a living wage, clothes are a lot more expensive. While individual actions are
        important, it’s important to not lose sight of the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <div class = "yerr">
      <p> Large companies like SHEIN and H&M will continue to exploit their workers in unsafe environments if legal action
        is not taken place. Clothes will continue to be mass produced and we can not blame individuals for the actions of
        a corporation. Individually, we do not have the power to stop a company from emitting over 6.2 million tons of CO2
        in the air (Unpacking Shein’s claims to..). We must put pressure on our government and enforce better industry
        regulations.
