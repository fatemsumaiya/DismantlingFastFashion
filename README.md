# Dismantling Fast Fashion

**Dismantling Fast Fashion** is more than just a website—it’s part of a movement. We expose the dark side of fast fashion, from mountains of discarded clothing polluting our planet to exploitative labor practices. Brands churn out trendy pieces at breakneck speed, only for them to be tossed aside when styles change. But you have the power to disrupt this cycle. Learn how to shop smarter, make sustainable choices, and push for a fashion industry that values people and the planet.
